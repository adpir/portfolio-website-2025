          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            SL8 was inspired by personal experience and validated through
            interviews with actors and casting professionals. Research uncovered
            a heavy reliance on unreliable platforms like social media, with
            limited support for location-based casting. A competitive analysis
            revealed critical gaps — low trust, poor filtering, and vague
            project listings — emphasizing the need for a centralized, reliable
            platform tailored to discovering and connecting with local talent.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>
            The solution is to create an inclusive platform that connects
            casting professionals with local actors. SL8 streamlines talent
            discovery and verification, allowing actors to showcase their skills
            while enabling casting directors to find talent based on location,
            experience, and demographics through an easy-to-use swipe interface.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>
            Interviews were conducted with actors from diverse ethnic
            backgrounds and varying age groups to understand their current
            methods and challenges in finding auditions. Participants commonly
            relied on social media platforms to discover opportunities and
            showcase their talents. The research explored their audition-finding
            habits, engagement with social platforms, key challenges faced, and
            desired features in an actor-focused social app. Insights
            highlighted the need for streamlined audition discovery, improved
            networking capabilities, and functionalities tailored specifically
            to actors' professional needs.

          <p>
            I conducted several interviews to understand user behaviors and
            preferences. User interviews revealed consistent patterns in needs
            and challenges. The data helped validate design decisions and
            prioritize features that support seamless connections between actors
            and casting directors.

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            To better understand the gaps in the current casting experience, I
            conducted a competitive analysis of platforms like
            <em>BeScene</em> and <em>Project Casting</em>. While both aim to
            connect talent with opportunities, they fall short in several key
            areas.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Poor SEO performance, limiting visibility and reach</li>
            <li>
              No location-based recommendations, making local talent discovery
              difficult
            </li>
            <li>Filter functionality is unreliable or ineffective</li>
            <li>Frequent app crashes and technical issues</li>
            <li>Cluttered UI and poor layout structure</li>
            <li>
              Fonts and text are difficult to read, affecting accessibility
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>
            After conducting in-depth interviews, I gained insights into the
            need for an app to streamline the posting of auditions and find
            diverse local talent. These insights were crucial in shaping the
            design and functionality of the web app to meet the diverse
            requirements of the local audition community.

          <h3>User Flow & Journey Mapping</h3>
          <p>
            I created user flows and journey maps for both actors and casting
            directors, identifying critical actions like browsing talent,
            submitting to projects, and saving favorites. These helped define
            the app's structure and ensured a seamless experience for both sides
            of the platform.

          <h2>Lo-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            Low- and mid-fidelity wireframes were developed to establish layout,
            interactions, and content hierarchy. I focused on simplifying the
            interface and prioritizing intuitive actions, like swiping and
            filtering by location or experience. This evolved into a
            high-fidelity prototype informed by iterative feedback.

            User feedback helped refine the swipe interface, profile cards, and
            discovery features. I adjusted flows and visuals to better support
            trust, ease of use, and discoverability, ensuring the final design
            addressed both user needs and business goals.

              creativity of the acting world while maintaining trust and
              clarity. The color palette, typography, and UI elements were
              crafted to feel modern, inclusive, and user-friendly.
